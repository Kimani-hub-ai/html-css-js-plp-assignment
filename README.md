## 🚀 Project Overview

This website was built as a portfolio to demonstrate my front-end development skills using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It includes multiple pages:

- **Home Page** – Welcome message, visual branding, and navigation
- **About Me Page** – An introduction to who I am, what I do, and what I love
- **Contact Page** – A functional and styled contact form for communication

The project reflects my journey from learning basic web development to building decentralized apps like [CoinWryt](#) and smart biometric systems like **Smart Attend**.
